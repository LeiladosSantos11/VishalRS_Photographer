I built this project using:
- HTML,
- CSS,
- Boostrap

What I most like adding on to this website were the principles of ux design:

1. Balance and alignment
2. Contrast
3. Repetition
4. White space
5. Color
6. Typography
7. Accessibility 


I also started to use {rem} and {em} insteady of pixels when styling the web page. 
It was a great experience to add this particulary skill to control the responsive design in different screen sizes and add accessibity.

I recognize it is a small project. However, I enjoyed to learn more about CSS and ux design and most of all to be able to apply those skills in this project.
