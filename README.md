I built this project using:
- HTML,
- CSS,
- Boostrap

What I most like to add on this website was the principles of ux design:

1. Balance and alignment
2. Contrast
3. Repetition
4. White space
5. Accessibility 

I also started to use rem and em insteady of pixels. 
It was a great experience to add this skill to control the responsive design in different screen sizes and add accessibity.

I recognize is a small project but I enjoyed to learn more about CSS and ux design and most of all be able to apply those skills in this project.
